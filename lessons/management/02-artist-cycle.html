                <p>The Artist Cycle A part of being an artist is understanding the typical artist cycle or release cycle. The average cycle can take up to 18 months to complete. It includes the writing and recording process, followed by the pre-release marketing process, the release marketing, followed by the tour marketing and repeat. This can diﬀer depending on your release strategy, but this is the most used strategy in the music industry. Some artists also release music while they are on tour. But consistency is crucial.</p>
<p>The diagram below portrays that instead of spending all your marketing and promotions budget on a short-span campaign directly upon your release and only focusing on communicating with your fans during the release marketing phase, you should be doing so all year round, all the time. With the growth of social media and streaming platforms, it is pretty common knowledge and natural in today&#x27;s day and age.</p>
<p>Writing and recording Generally, artists most commonly release singles instead of albums since most people listen to playlists and don’t take the time to listen to a full album. This means you have to try releasing new singles regularly to get and stay on those playlists. We would highly recommend removing it every month. It works well to make remixes/bootlegs and covers when you are more upcoming, so people recognize the original and are more likely to listen to it and get introduced to your sound. This also works well for DJs since they are always on the look for new edits that ﬁt their style. Make sure you got the right to release remixes and covers in stores. Otherwise, stick to SoundCloud and YouTube and use the ‘Common Creative Rights.’ Make sure you plan your time in the studio never to miss your deadlines.</p>
<p>If you are still interested in making an album, we advise taking more time than a month to write and record your music.</p>
<p>Pre-release marketing</p>
<p>This is when you excite your fans and let them know something is coming up. This means playing the track in your mixes or concerts, sharing teasers on social media, and shopping to record labels. Everything to promote your song and prepare your release. If you release the music yourself, don’t forget to create a good artwork for your track; ﬁnd someone to do it if you can’t do it yourself. ﬁverr.com is a helpful website to discover creatives. Also, don’t forget to upload your song insigniﬁcant advance to streaming platforms. At the latest two weeks in advance, the earlier you are, the better chances you end up in curated playlists.</p>
<p>Release marketing On the day your release goes live, promotions begin. The climb continues as long as you want them, but depending on how well you’ve planned and how much fans like it, your promotions could last for another year or dwindle after months. Promotion includes radio tours. Television and other media interviews, creative media partnerships, and streaming promotions. This could take as long as there is momentum. The more you are known, the easier it is to build a more extended momentum. That is why we recommend a releasing cycle of 1 month for singles. This means you can promote your other product every other month. We recommend doing interviews only with original singles/albums.</p>
<p>Tour marketing If you are well known and have a solid fan base, you could organize a tour to promote your new song or album. For most of you, you will perform consistently and perform multiple of your recent releases.</p>
<p>To Do</p>
<p>Create a release cycle in your agenda and plan everything you need to do for a successful release. Make sure you plan and be consistent in your releases.</p>
