                <article class="article-content">
                    <p class="article-intro">The music industry runs on relationships. Your network can open doors that talent alone cannot. But here's the truth: you won't build that network by hiding in your studio or sitting at home. The electronic music scene has a solid social fabric, and the most successful artists understand that real connections happen in real places—on dance floors, in DJ booths, and at the events where music comes alive.</p>
                    
                    <p>This chapter isn't about collecting business cards or adding LinkedIn connections. It's about getting out there, immersing yourself in the scene you're creating music for, and building genuine relationships with the people who matter. Whether you're looking for collaborators, bookers, labels, or media coverage, they're all out there every weekend—and so should you be.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Get Off Your Ass and Get Out There</h2>
                    <p>One of the first things you should do is get off your ass! The electronic music scene has a solid social fabric. You won't become a successful artist just by hiding in the studio all day or sitting at home or gaming. You're making music for clubs and festivals. So you need to know the environment you're creating it for.</p>
                    
                    <p>Also, all the relevant people you need to know are in the clubs and festivals every weekend on the dance floor and in the DJ booth. That's where you find your potential fans, that DJ that might play your tracks, and the journalist that might write about your music. So. Do you think they spend their weekends at home behind laptops? Hell no!</p>
                    
                    <p>And last but not least, you will get inspired by the music, people and impressions at the parties. And if you're not going to party, at least do something that takes you out of the comfort zone of your studio and living room. For example, David Guetta frequently goes to the opera to get new impressions. He always gets inspired to make fresh tracks.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Where to Go</h2>
                    <p>If you don't know where to go, go where you'll hear the music you like and where the artists are playing that you feel most connected to. You make the best connections when you are having fun. And even though you might be nervous about the networking part, don't worry.</p>
                    
                    <h2>How to Network at Events</h2>
                    <p>Breathe, dance, have faith in yourself and the music, and keep in mind that you're not the only one trying to make a connection. Most people who are relevant to you are also out there to connect. Just don't be too pushy about selling your music. Be patient.</p>
                    
                    <p>First, find out who the decision-makers are. Then step up to them when the time feels right. This may take a few nights out, but getting involved in a scene takes time. And remember, this is only the research part. You don't have to make a connection just yet. You are just finding out about the scene.</p>
                    
                    <p>But even when you're not ready to connect, always make sure you carry a USB stick or two. After all, you never know whom you are going to run into.</p>

                            <p>Networking is a long game. Focus on building genuine relationships rather than immediately asking for favors. The best connections happen naturally when you're both enjoying the music and the moment.</p>
