                <p>Building Your Network One of the ﬁrst things you should do is get oﬀ your ass! The electronic music scene has a solid social fabric. You won’t become a successful artist just by hiding in the studio all day or sitting at home or gaming. You’re making music for clubs and festivals. So you need to know the environment you’re creating it for. Also, all the relevant people you need to know are in the clubs and festivals every weekend on the dance ﬂoor and in the DJ booth. That’s where you ﬁnd your potential fans, that DJ that might play your tracks, and the journalist that might write about jour music. So. Do you think they spend their weekends at home behind laptops? Hell no!</p>
<p>And last but not least, you will get inspired by the music, people and impressions at the parties. And if you’re not going to party, at least do something that takes you out of the comfort zone of your studio and living room. For example, David Guetta frequently goes to the opera to get new Impressions. He always gets inspired to make fresh tracks. If you don’t know where to go, go where you’ll hear the music you like and where the artists are playing that you feel most connected. You make the best connections when you are having fun. And even though you might be nervous about the networking part, don’t worry.</p>
<p>Breathe, dance, have faith in yourself and the music, and keep in mind that you’re not the only one trying to make a connection. Most people who are relevant to you are also out there to connect. Just don’t be too pushy about selling your music. Be patient. First, ﬁnd out who the decision-makers are. Then step up to them when the time feels right. This may take a few nights out, but getting involved in a scene takes time. And remember, this is only the research part. You don’t have to make a connection just yet. You are just ﬁnding out about the scene. But even when you’re not ready to connect, always make sure you carry a USB stick or two. After all, you never know whom you are going to run into. decision-makers are. Then step up to them when the time feels right. This may take a few nights out, but getting involved in a scene takes time. And remember, this is only the research part. You don’t have to make a connection just yet. You are just ﬁnding out about the scene. But even when you’re not ready to connect, always make sure you carry a USB stick or two. After all, you never know whom you are going to run into.</p>
<p>Now that you know this open the ‘My Network’ document at the bottom of this chapter and ﬁll in all the people essential for your career to be successful. This could be everyone from a friend who is good at taking photos to a stranger with a popular playlist.</p>
