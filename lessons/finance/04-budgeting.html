                <p>Budgeting To ensure your business doesn’t go bankrupt, we have to make sure there is money for all your business expenses. The easiest way to do this is by making budgets. Calculate how much money you need for every subject and track how much money you have spent and remaining on that subject. There are a couple of diﬀerent ways to do this; apps like Flow &amp; Mint. You can also use an excel sheet like the budgeting example sheet in the attachment at the bottom of this chapter.</p>
<p>In some cases, your bank supports budgets like BUNQ. If you are interested, here is a signup link: https://bunq.app/invite/RobinSalmonGoose (Not sponsored) I’ve used for the past years. I create diﬀerent bank accounts/budgets to put on enough money for all the calculated expenses. When I spend money, I click the matching bank account to see how much money is left for that month. All the extra money I make is sent to a savings account to top up the other bank accounts/budgets every month. I have to make sure I earn more money than I spend, making sure the company grows. If you pay less than you have budgeted, you save on that subject for more considerable expenses later on—for example, equipment. You might need to adjust your budgets as your company develops, for example, when you hire people.</p>
<p>To do: Write down all your monthly expenses and place them in the correct category and count them up. Then create your budgeting administration. Use the documents in the attachment at the bottom of this chapter.</p>
