                <p>Storytelling If you learned about the fan journey in our management course, you know how important it is to create enough information about yourself for your fans. It is your story that keeps them engaged. This chapter will teach you everything about storytelling to grow and maintain your fan base at every step of the fan journey. Creating a story that stands out is diﬃcult in our crowded online world ﬁlled with pop-ups and ﬂashy advertisements. Attracting and keeping someone’s attention means you need to deliver the right content at the right time to the right audience. Therefore, the more relevant your story is, the more impact you will have on your fans to become loyal, long-term, valuable fans. Studies conﬁrm that social storytelling is responsible for at least 65% of conversations in public. That’s much storytelling. So what if you approach your audience like you’re sharing information with your friends. You’ll gain more and better engagement with them. A great movie with a story that moves you, a hilarious joke. These things stick with you and linger long after the story or joke has been told, the movie has been seen, or the article has been read. Once you’ve generated emotion and become an inspirator, you can impact your fans. You need to touch them, make them laugh, make them cry or think. Make them feel something for them to think something of you. You know, emotions drive the decision-making process. And so stories sell.</p>
<p>While creating your story, it’s essential to keep your bigger purpose in mind, which we have discussed before. Because your audience is not responding to what you do, but why you do it, remember? They should believe in what you believe. Now let’s take a look at some stories on social media capturing a storyline with its text and visuals. Remember that these examples are small stories, so they are part of a bigger story. These examples should inspire you in creating your bigger story, which will be divided into several storylines and should occur on all your channels. Your audience should recognize that the storylines align and are part of the bigger story. They make a perfect ﬁt together and are consistent.</p>
<p>These stories aﬀect the way we feel and, therefore, how we act and behave. This is done with only one picture. This content drives our decision-making process as it’s compelling and relevant. And so we follow these people, like their messages, congratulate them and support them. Imagine what you can do.</p>
<p>To get to this core, we should ﬁrst capture your key message. Starting with your key message, we will deﬁne your bigger story and accompany storylines. But before you get to work. We will give some other examples to get you inspired.</p>
<p>Dove They use social media storytelling focusing on real people and their stories. Expressly, women in every shape and every color represent women all over. This focuses on their target audience so their fans will relate to this content and identify with it.</p>
<p>Nike Another great example is checking out their Instagram, and you will see their particular stories with a dream. Personal stories, quotes, and pictures as they show strong emotions and relatable people from all over. This will touch you.</p>
<p>Airbnb Their key message: ‘Belong anywhere and live like a local’ with Instagram pictures that capture unique places and homey houses. The copywriting is personal, an atmospheric story that</p>
<p>describes the feel of the place and people. This makes you feel welcome and want to go there immediately.</p>
<p>National Geographic The number one brand on social media with over 350 million followers globally. The average is 20.374 engagements for every post on social, more than most brands. Nadine Hetchy, V.P . of brand partnership, shared her thoughts on National Geographic’s key to success; staying true to your brand; being timely with your content; using the power of wow and wonder, and embracing new technologies to tell stories. They call it the power of visuals and great storytelling.</p>
<p>We hope you got some inspiration for your storytelling and key messages, which will become the core of the content you will develop. In the next chapter, we will talk about how to create content for your social media channels. Open the storytelling worksheet below to start thinking about your story and key messages.</p>
