                <p>Writing a Press Release Regardless of writing personal messages when reaching out to journalists. It’s always a good idea to write a general press release. This is a text that you can enclose with your personal email. It has all the relevant information written as it is almost already written in an article. This is important. Journalists may very well quote parts of it, and lazy ones may even copy past the entire press release and post it on their blog. But for them to do so, it has to meet speciﬁc criteria. Let’s see what you need to do to write a general press release.</p>
<p>Write formally &amp; in the third person Unlike social posts, press releases need to be written formally and in the third person - practically written like a possible article. You want journalists to copy as much of your text as possible. If you’re lucky, the media will even copy the entire text. You have to write about what you’re promoting (music, event, etc.) like you’re someone else writing about you.   1st paragraph: who, what, where, when, (how) Always start with the essential information. You want the people you address to be able to scan the email and ﬁnd all the info as quickly as possible. In the ﬁrst paragraph, ensure you answer the ‘who, what, where, when, (how)’ questions.   2nd/3rd paragraph: short elaboration &amp; newsworthiness This is where you can elaborate on what you’re promoting and why it’s worthwhile reporting on. Remember to think about the ﬁve elements of newsworthiness.   Last paragraph: summary &amp; date of release/ticket sale/event In the previous section, it’s good to resume what you’ve talked about in one sentence. And then to end with mentioning when your product or project is being released and/or when the ticket sale starts.   Note for editorial staﬀ Always write your contact details under the press release.</p>
<p>You never know if a journalist may want to reach out for more information or an interview. Write it as follows:   --- Note for editorial staﬀ - Not for publication:  For questions or further information, please contact:  - name - e-mail - tel  No bragging Even though you’re writing as though you’re someone else, it’s not smart to brag about yourself. You don’t have to be shy about what you’re doing. This is a promotional text. But writing that you’re the best or most fantastic artist on the planet is something for the independent press to decide. The art is to write something favorable about yourself without sounding arrogant.   No fake news Don’t write down statements you haven’t fact-checked. You might come across as silly or as a liar. For instance: “One of the hottest DJs in Detroit” playing at your event, when they are really</p>
<p>from Chicago, makes you look like you have little knowledge of the music you promote. Or saying that your previous track was in the Beatport Top 10 when it didn’t make you look like you’re lying to make yourself sound more interesting. In both cases, journalists are likely to banish you to their spam folders.</p>
