                    <p class="article-intro">In this chapter, we are going to learn how to contact talent buyers from different venues. So before we can write an email to those buyers, we need to find their email addresses. It might be listed on the venue's website, but a good Google search can also help. If you have a personal email, that's great because now you can include this person's name, and the chance that they read it is also much more extensive. If you can't find a contact person, use their general mail address.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Writing Your Email</h2>
                    <p>Remember you are selling a show here! Paint a picture in their mind about your music and your excellent live performance. Tell them how long your show is and why it fits their venue. Don't oversell yourself, but also don't undersell yourself. Just be honest. Mention the date you would like to play there after you have checked what event takes place. Ask if there is still room left in their lineup. You can also ask for surrounding dates if that lineup is already filled. Don't forget to add your up-to-date press kit. You might also want to share a video of a booming gig you had earlier to give them an impression. Since we have researched where your fans are from, we can also mention how many fans live close to this venue. If you have no prior experience or shows, aim for smaller venues and send them the music you are making and that you would like to expand your audience.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The Subject Line</h2>
                    <p>Be smart about the subject line you will use, as this has to grab their attention. Never use the word URGENT. If you don't have any inspiration, you can also say [Artist Name] in [City] on [Date]. Keep your mail short and to the point.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Follow-Up Strategy</h2>
                    <p>After you have sent your mail, put a reminder in your Calendar in 7 days or so. If they haven't already replied to you in 7 days, then ask them again and say, 'I just wanted to make sure you have received this email'. Every so often, email them to update them about any new bookings along with your tour routing (if you are touring) to show them your tour is coming together and they might miss their opportunity. Stay in touch, but don't harass them. Consider getting in touch every week to 2 weeks, and if they never reply after 3-4 mails, just move on to another venue.</p>
