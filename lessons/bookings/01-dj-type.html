                <article class="article-content">
                    <p class="article-intro">Before you can get booked, you need to understand what kind of DJ you are. This determines which venues you target and how you position yourself. Music Directors are always looking for new talents alongside already established artists. So this could be contemporary artists trying to break into the scene and an artist who is already well experienced in producing music or playing records for a long time for a small crowd. And nowadays, with so many fish in the sea, it is essential to stand out, and there are many ways. But in the end, it all comes down to your skills and if you like to perform and entertain the crowd. Before we look into what type of DJ you are, let's look at a few generic types of DJs.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The Performer</h2>
                    <p>Think about DJs like The Black Madonna, Jeff Miles, or Mr. Scruff. These are craftspeople whose most essential qualities are their DJ skills, knowledge of music, and ability to make the crowd dance. These artists are commonly booked as residents of clubs and as build-up DJs before the headliner. In some scenes, they are referred to as a selector, storyteller, or DJ DJs. They can create the right atmosphere because they can adapt well to various crowds in different situations. You won't find these DJs in the charts so often as the DJ / Producer dominates them.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The DJ / Producer</h2>
                    <p>Think about Martin Garrix, The Chainsmokers, and Marshmello. These DJs are primarily electronic music producers who perform as a DJ playing his and other people's music or as a live act. Most commonly, they start as bedroom producers who became famous because of their releases. The greater the success of their productions, the more fans they gain and the more tickets they sell. Which makes them interesting and valuable for buyers. Their biggest challenge is to create an experience that matches the quality of their productions. They have to release new tracks regularly to stay relevant. Keep in mind that a good producer is not per se a good DJ and vice versa.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The DJ / Curator</h2>
                    <p>Now let's think about artists like Armin van Buuren, Richie Hawtin, Nina Kraviz, Solomon, or Joris Voorn. These type of DJs represents a platform or a brand. These platforms could be a label, an event organization, a podcast or radio show, or any other organization where they can be used as a curator. These artists are commonly booked because they represent these organizations, sounds, or movements. The more followers these organizations have, the more attractive they are for buyers as they often have their stage or label night. The greatest challenge for these DJs is finding like-minded talents and making sure that their platform's content is consistent in both output and quality.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The DJ / Influencer</h2>
                    <p>Artists like Idris Elba, Salvatore Ganacci, or Paris Hilton have become very common in recent years. This is primarily a celebrity or influencer who is also a DJ. Often they became famous before they became a DJ. These types of DJs are booked for their following and marketing value. Their biggest challenge is to prove, once on stage, that they can also perform on a quality level both musically and technically.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Finding Your Path</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes, artists start in a different category than they are right now as their personalities and challenges are involved. Example: The Performer is searching for their sound to speak to a broader audience. They have become so famous for their sound and have shifted to the DJ / Producer category.</p>
                    
                    <h2>DJ Categories</h2>
                    <ul class="content-list">
                        <li>Resident DJ: Regular at one venue, building local following</li>
                        <li>Touring DJ: Travels for bookings, broader reach</li>
                        <li>Producer/DJ: Creates own music, plays own productions</li>
                        <li>Open format: Plays across genres for varied crowds</li>
                        <li>Specialist: Deep expertise in specific genre</li>
                    </ul>
