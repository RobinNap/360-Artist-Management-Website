                <article class="article-content">
                    <p class="article-intro">Now that you have done all the preparations for an incredible performance let me explain to you all you need to know about your performance in a club or festival. First of all, make sure you're always on time! Usually, festivals and clubs ask you to be present an hour before your performance. It is good to aim for that hour. If there is one thing talent buyers don't like, it's an artist who is too late for the show. Besides, being an hour early will give you the chance to get used to the room, see what the crowds react to, feel the vibe, and check out the artist playing before you. If you are the first artist on the bill, it's also good to be at least half an hour early. Besides feeling the vibe and getting ready, you can also meet the people behind the venue, like the artist handler, the technicians, and the bar people. People always like an artist who says hello. It's a courtesy much appreciated. It's just like real life.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Equipment Preparation</h2>
                    <p>Make sure your equipment is up to par. Always have a working pair of headphones or in-ears, and always bring an extra memory card or another device with a backup of your music. You never know if some equipment is or gets damaged.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Professional Behavior</h2>
                    <p>And don't get intoxicated before, during, and after your set. If you are nervous, it sometimes helps to have a beer to take the edge off. But becoming drunk or intoxicated in any way is never a good idea. It may affect the quality of your set and your social interactions. Go about your work as professionally as possible. You still have the rest of your career to be an absolute rockstar.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Taking Over from the Previous Artist</h2>
                    <p>When you take over from the artist before you, it's common courtesy to let their last track play until the outro. And even though you shouldn't have your entire set planned out from second to second (unless you are a live-set or headliner), it might help to know at least the first 1-3 songs you're going to play. And if the vibe is not fitting those songs, don't hesitate to turn the plan around. As mentioned before, the best DJ set is a symbiosis between the DJ and the crowd.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Playing Your Set</h2>
                    <p>If you are playing a warmup set, you need to get the vibe going. It's ok to have a few climaxes in your set but remember you are the appetizer to the main course. If you are playing prime time, you have to give the crowd what they want. It would help find the right balance between pleasing your crowd and playing what is closest to your heart. Always bear in mind at what time your set ends. It usually doesn't matter if your last record is a few minutes overtime. Still, it is common courtesy to notify the artist playing after you that you are about to play your latest song or ask them if it is ok to play another song. They will appreciate it.</p>
                    
                    <h2>After Your Set</h2>
                    <p>After your set, it is nice to check out your colleague and chat with the promoter or talent buyer. It is always good to ask what they thought about your performance. Don't be discouraged if the talent buyer criticizes your performance; see this as an opportunity to learn.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Tips During Your Show</h2>
                    <ul class="content-list">
                        <li>If you got a big night coming up, it is always good to think about recording the performance not just because it can be great content to share afterward but also to share it with talent buyers and to analyze it for yourself.</li>
                        <li>It's also good to have someone taking pictures and videos, or at least make a few pics and vids yourself. And don't forget to update your socials.</li>
                        <li>Prepare a few other USBs with your best DJ set. In case something goes wrong during your set, you have a backup to go to.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>Getting Booked Again</h2>
                    <p>Now that you have completed your booking, you probably wonder how can I get booked again? First of all, it doesn't help to ask for a booking. You can always say how much you liked playing there. And you can ask the talent buyer or promotor to keep them updated about fantastic information. Just don't specifically ask for another booking. If the talent buyer liked your set, they would indeed consider booking you again. You should have some cards with your contact details at all times. You never know if someone is interested in booking you. If you are a DJ/Producer, it also helps to have your music on a USB or SoundCloud. The more you build your network, the more you will get asked to play at different clubs and festivals again. This is a beginning of a successful music career.</p>
