                <p>Stage Performance As an artist and brand, one of the essential products you sell is your stage performance. So your interpretation must be on point. You’re working in the entertainment business, so people want to be entertained. Find a way that works for you. As I’ve said before, every human is diﬀerent, so it is no use copying someone else’s work. Find your perfect ﬁt, and remember your strong points as well.</p>
<p>Example: If you have an outgoing personality, there are no limits on stage. The crazier, the better… Think about Steve Aoki and his boats and throwing cakes. Or Salvatore Ganacci and all his crazy dance moves.</p>
<p>Steve Aoki</p>
<p>Salvatore Ganacci</p>
<p>If you’re more of an introvert, don’t worry. It would help if you found a way to feel comfortable on stage and entertaining for the crowd. Some artists decide to let the music speak when they do their performance. Some artists focus more on the visual aspect—for example, Eric Prydz or The Chemical Brothers.</p>
<p>Eric Prydz</p>
<p>The Chemical Brothers</p>
<p>There are more roads that lead to Rome, think outside of the box. The way you communicate online has to connect with your performance; imagine Steve Aoki being soft online while he is the most outgoing DJ out of them all when you see him perform. Everything has to match.</p>
