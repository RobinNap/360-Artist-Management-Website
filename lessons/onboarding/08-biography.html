                    <p class="article-intro">As an artist, it is essential to have an artist biography. It is the story behind the person. Before you can write a good biography, we need to build a narrative around your brand.</p>
                    <h2>Building Your Narrative</h2>
                    <p>Four things define a narrative:</p>
                    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal; padding-left: 1.75rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; color: var(--text-secondary);">
                        <li style="padding: 0.5rem 0;">Who you are</li>
                        <li style="padding: 0.5rem 0;">Your core values</li>
                        <li style="padding: 0.5rem 0;">What you've achieved</li>
                        <li style="padding: 0.5rem 0;">What you still like to achieve</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Who You Are</h3>
                    <p>The first part of who you are should be about your details. Example: I'm Robin Nap, born in 1997 in Utrecht, The Netherlands. After stopping my professional career as a DJ and producer, I wanted to give back to new talents. Therefore, I started a platform called 360 Artist Management where I share free resources for independent up-and-coming talent.</p>
                    <div class="callout callout-tip">
                        <div class="callout-icon">💡</div>
                        <div class="callout-content">
                            <h4>Tip</h4>
                            <p>Use your birth year instead of your age in your biography, as age can quickly become outdated.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Your Core Values</h3>
                    <p>The second part is about what you stand for (core values). Example: I aim to run the most helpful artist platform in the world.</p>
                    <h3>What You've Achieved</h3>
                    <p>The third part is about determining what you've already achieved. If you're at the start, this part is not that relevant yet. But it is essential to keep track of your milestones, no matter how big or small they are.</p>
                    <h3>What You Still Want to Achieve</h3>
                    <p>The fourth part is about defining what you would still like to achieve. Where you would like to go as an artist and brand, what should the ultimate moment in your career look like?</p>
                    <h2>Writing Your Biography</h2>
                    <p>So now that you have to build your narrative, it is finally time to develop your biography! We can use the things you have written down in your narrative but make sure your bio is not bigger than three paragraphs.</p>
                    <h3>First Paragraph: Your Unique Selling Point</h3>
                    <p>In the first paragraph, you should state who you are and what the music, aesthetic, and scene you represent. This is what, in marketing terms, is called your unique selling point or USP.</p>
                    <h3>Second and Third Paragraphs: Your Journey</h3>
                    <p>In the second and third paragraphs, you should have a timeline of how you came to this point. This is where you can list your influences and achievements. Don't worry when you have just started and don't have many accomplishments to list yet. You can make it a two-paragraph biography if you need to.</p>
                    <h3>Third Paragraph: Looking Forward</h3>
                    <p>In the third paragraph, you should refer to your unique selling point again and end with an aspiration or an exciting event in the near future. Example: With the festival season slowly filling up with bookings, this promises to be a fantastic summer for Martin Garrix.</p>
                    <h2>Three Versions You Need</h2>
                    <p>Create different lengths for different purposes:</p>
                    <ul class="content-list">
                        <li>Short (50 words): For social media profiles</li>
                        <li>Medium (150 words): For event listings and quick references</li>
                        <li>Long (300+ words): For press kits and detailed features</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Final Steps</h2>
                    <p>Now let's write a biography. When you are done, you can translate your biography into English or your mother language, depending on what language you started. Save your bio in a word file. You can write links to your website or SoundCloud at the bottom of your bio if you want.</p>
                    <div class="callout callout-tip">
                        <div class="callout-icon">💡</div>
                        <div class="callout-content">
                            <h4>Writing Tips</h4>
                            <p>Avoid clichés like 'passionate about music since childhood' or 'genre-defying sound.' Be specific and authentic. Use your narrative as a guide, but make it flow naturally. You could use AI to improve your bio, but always review and personalize it to ensure it sounds like you.</p>
                            <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Keep it updated:</strong> It is important to keep your bio up to date as your career evolves. Update it whenever you have new achievements, releases, or significant milestones.</p>
