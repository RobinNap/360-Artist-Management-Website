                <p>Press Photos As an artist, you need excellent and high-quality press photos. This doesn&#x27;t mean that they only have to be shot with a high resolution because nowadays, every phone can do that. No, they have to be shot with a high-quality camera and good lighting, etc. This is because your photos will be used for every proﬁle picture online, ﬂyers, posters, and maybe merchandise. Your press photos should match your logo and other brand-related stuﬀ.</p>
<p>Example: If you went for the deep and dark theme in the previous model, your press photos might end up being dark and moody. Not too much color use, for instance. Just keep things minimalistic and dark.</p>
<p>TIP: It is crucial to keep your photos up-to-date because you change as a person, so we recommend doing a photoshoot every year.</p>
<p>To do: create your mood board. Try to ﬁnd pictures of artists that visualize your brand ideally. You will end up having multiple photos in one place. Try to ﬁnd the thread that links them all together. Do most images have many colors? That could be your thread. Do most people laugh or look serious? That could be a thread, etc.</p>
<p>After you ﬁnd your style, it is time to shoot some photos! There are a few ways to ﬁnd someone who can make your pictures.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask on your social media who has experience doing portrait photos and is willing to help. They might do it for free to have material for their portfolio.</li>
<li>Search on Google for photographers who are not too expensive who can shoot portrait photos. From our experience, these shoots will cost you around €175. Some of these studios also have make-up and or photo editing included. We recommend doing this to have smoother skin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>You do not need a studio per se. There are many great outside locations. Such as industrial locations.</li>
<li>Share your mood board with the person who will make your pictures to understand better what you are looking for.</li>
<li>Be aware of the clothing you use. This should also match your brand style.</li>
<li>Think about what kind of colors and, or props you want to use.</li>
<li>In the end, you should select 5 of your best photos. If you have a career coach, you can sit together to choose the best one! Make sure you have at least one full-body picture.</li>
<li>Don’t make it too crazy if you wear a heavy costume. You have to wear it for the rest of your career.</li>
<li>Use a good photo made of you during your performance.</li>
<li>Never forget to mention the photographer in articles where these photos are used.</li>
