                <p>Creating Your Press Kit (EPK) If you have followed all the chapters correctly, you should have the following items on your computer. In this chapter, we will extend this to create a complete package.</p>
<ul>
<li>Artist Name</li>
<li>Logo</li>
<li>Press Photos</li>
<li>Biography</li>
<li>Tracks with your sound</li>
</ul>
<p>So you have been building your brand over time, and suddenly, you get a booking request. A promotor is interested in booking you because he has seen your name on the internet multiple times, they liked what they heard and saw on your socials and now is convinced that you are the right person for this gig. Changed are big that they are going to ask for a press kit.</p>
<p>A press kit is a folder that includes all the information someone could need to promote you correctly. You don&#x27;t want to be on a ﬂyer with a press picture from ﬁve years old. Aside from the fact that you have aged over the years, your brand might have changed as well.</p>
<p>So here is what should be included in your press kit:</p>
<ul>
<li>High-quality press photos</li>
<li>High-quality videos of some of the shows you have done</li>
<li>Logo’s</li>
<li>Biography</li>
<li>Discography</li>
<li>Your Social Media handles</li>
<li>Your font (if you use a speciﬁc font for your communication)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s dive a little bit into every part.</p>
<p>High-quality press photos We already talked about creating press photos for your brand. These photos should be included in your Press Kit. Pick one to 5 photos that you think are the best and add those to the press kit.</p>
<p>High-quality videos of some of the shows you have done If you have some high-quality videos from some of your gigs you can use these to give the promotor an impression of what you do.</p>
<p>Logo’s</p>
<p>The logo that you have created for your brand should be in the press kit too. Make sure to add the highest quality possible so that the designer can use it for their ﬂyers, posters, and online content. I would suggest adding a .PNG, .JPG, and .PSD ﬁle.</p>
<p>Biography As an artist, you have a story. This is your biography. A biography should be a short story about an artist. What makes you, you? How did it all start, and what are your core values? This could be in the press kit in a simple word document. I recommend having the biography in both English and your mother language.</p>
<p>Discography This is an overview of all the songs you have worked on. This gives the promotor the ability to recognize your work and promote it.</p>
<p>Your Social Media Handles Send all the correct links to your social media so that the promotor won&#x27;t end up promoting the wrong person. This could be sent in a word document.</p>
<p>Your Font Some artists use a particular font representing their brand; if that’s the case, make sure to put the font ﬁle in the press kit.</p>
<p>Now that you have ﬁlled this folder, it is time to Zipp it and upload it to Google Drive or your website, so it is easy to share later on. People rather have you send a link than all the documents in an email because it will ﬁll their email until they can receive any emails anymore.</p>
