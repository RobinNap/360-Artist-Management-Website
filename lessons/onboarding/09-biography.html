                <p>Biography As an artist, it is essential to have an artist biography. It is the story behind the person. Before you can write a good biography, we need to build a narrative around your brand. Four things deﬁne a narrative.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who you are.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Your core values</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What you&#x27;ve achieved</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What you still like to achieve.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ﬁrst part of who you are should be about your details. Example: I’m Robin Nap, 24 years old, born in Utrecht, The Netherlands. I’m the founder of the 360 Artist Group, a platform for all kinds of artists who would like to have help in their artist careers but want to stay independent.</p>
<p>The second part is about what you stand for (core values). Example: I aim to run the most helpful artist platform in the world.</p>
<p>The third part is about determining what you&#x27;ve already achieved. If you’re at the start, this part is not that relevant yet. But it is essential to keep track of your milestones, no matter how big or small they are.</p>
<p>The fourth part is about deﬁning what you would still like to achieve. Where you would like to go as an artist and brand, what should the ultimate moment in your career look like?</p>
<p>Let’s open the narrative worksheet in the attachment at the bottom of this chapter.</p>
<p>So now that you have to build your narrative, it is ﬁnally time to develop your biography! We can use the things you have written down in your narrative but make sure your bio is not bigger than three paragraphs. In the ﬁrst paragraph, you should state who you are and what the music, aesthetic, and scene you represent. This is what, in marketing terms, is called your unique selling point or USP .</p>
<p>In the second and third paragraphs, you should have a timeline of how you came to this point. This is where you can list your inﬂuences and achievements. Don’t worry when you have just started and don&#x27;t have many accomplishments to list yet. You can make it a two-paragraph biography if you need to.</p>
<p>In the third paragraph, you should refer to your unique selling point again and end with an aspiration or an exciting event in the near future. Example: With the festival season slowly ﬁlling up with bookings, this promises to be a fantastic summer for Martin Garrix.</p>
<p>Now let’s write a biography. When you are done; you can translate your biography into English or your mother language. Depending on what langue you started. Save your bio in a word ﬁle. You can write links to your website or SoundCloud at the bottom of your bio if you want.</p>
