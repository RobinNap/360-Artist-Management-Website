                <p>Tone of Voice The way we communicate online is not that diﬀerent from communicating oﬄine. It’s just people we’re talking to. We tend to forget that. As a brand, you should pick a tone of voice that you have when you communicate. Are you going to be the person who responds to everything and isn&#x27;t afraid of showing his opinion? Or are you the person who plays safe and wants to be a nice guy?</p>
<p>Example: think about Deadmau5. Not a day goes by without him calling out another artist online. This probably ﬁts his personality; otherwise, he won&#x27;t be doing this consistently, but it’s also part of his branding because that’s what people know about him. His tone of voice is a strong point of his, which he used for his branding purposes. Below are a couple of tweets from Deadmau5.</p>
<p>So think about how you want to present yourself as an artist and brand. Also, in communicating to friends online. Everything you post under your artist social media channels is part of your branding. Some artists use private and public accounts to keep this separate.</p>
