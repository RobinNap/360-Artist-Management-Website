                <p>Online Presence Now that your Electronic Press Kit (EPK) is ﬁlled. It is time to use that content on all your social media channels. You probably already have several social media channels. If you don’t, you need to create them as soon as possible! Use your artist biography on all of them, and if it’s too long for some channels like Instagram, use a shortened version. Use your press photos on all of them. It’s essential that you have the same pictures up everywhere. This will enhance your recognizability and will make your channels look professional.</p>
<p>Once you have implemented your bio and photos on all social media channels, you should gather all the links on your socials and place them in a word ﬁle.</p>
<p>Please make sure you are active on all social media channels you use and think about using them diﬀerently. You might want to do live streams on Twitch, but share photo’s of your shows on Instagram. If you have a hard time ﬁnding content for your socials, think about the Brand House that we have used in the Core Values chapter and build a social media plan to help you manage your online presence.</p>
<p>We do not recommend automatically sharing content from one platform to another since this shortens your online exposure. If you post everything manually at diﬀerent times, people will see your content more often, and it will help them remember what you have posted.</p>
<p>Tip: The more active you will be on these platforms, the more likely you will get more exposure when you post something. Interact with your audience. Especially at the beginning of your career, it is wise to reply to everything.</p>
