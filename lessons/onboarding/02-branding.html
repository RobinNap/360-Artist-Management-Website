                <p>Branding Let’s talk about branding and why it is crucial for you as an artist.</p>
<p>If you would ask Google: What is a brand? The result would be; a type of product manufactured by a particular company under a speciﬁc name. That might not say much to you and me. I want to say that your brand is your reputation. Meaning; How do people talk about you when you are not there? What are the ﬁrst three things that come up in their minds? To ﬁgure this out, let&#x27;s ask some friends!</p>
<p><strong>Question 1. </strong>What Are the ﬁrst three things your friends think about when they hear your name? You can write down your answer in the attached document.</p>
<p>Answer 1:</p>
<p>Answer 2:</p>
<p>Answer 3:</p>
<p>These answers are crucial because they should match your brand values in the next chapter. You should consider here that you’re creating a personal brand because you are the brand as an artist!</p>
<p>So how can you tell that someone or something is the brand? Well, that is simple. Have you ever noticed that when you talk to someone about Deadmau5, they immediately know who it is and that they mention the mouse head? Or that when people talk about Daft Punk, they directly mention the masks?</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed that when someone buys shoes, they don&#x27;t tell you that they will buy shoes but instead say; I&#x27;m going to purchase Nike or Adidas? The brand is about how someone feels in the moment when they interact with you.</p>
<p>People have a prehistoric need to be part of something, part of a more signiﬁcant thing. That’s why it’s wired when you’re diﬀerent from someone else. At that moment, you’re not a part of the group anymore; you&#x27;ve become a black sheep. Surprisingly this is where the magic happens! Once you decide to be diﬀerent, you become attractive to people.</p>
<p>A fan also has a deep need to become part of something; in this case, it could be your brand. Remember how Lady Gaga has her ‘Little Monsters’ fan base and Justin Bieber has his ‘Beliebers’?</p>
<p>It all consists of people who feel connected with the artist&#x27;s brand. Of course, they like the music too, but the brand (a.k.a. the person) drives them to become a follower.</p>
<p>So what do you have to do to become a brand? Let’s talk about your Core Values in our next chapter!</p>
