                    <p class="article-intro">If you have followed all the chapters correctly, you should have the following items on your computer. In this chapter, we will extend this to create a complete Electronic Press Kit (EPK).</p>
                    <h2>What is an Electronic Press Kit (EPK)?</h2>
                    <p>An Electronic Press Kit (EPK) is a folder that includes all the information someone could need to promote you correctly. You don't want to be on a flyer with a press picture from five years old. Aside from the fact that you have aged over the years, your brand might have changed as well.</p>
                    <h2>Why You Need an Electronic Press Kit</h2>
                    <p>So you have been building your brand over time, and suddenly, you get a booking request. A promoter is interested in booking you because he has seen your name on the internet multiple times, they liked what they heard and saw on your socials and now is convinced that you are the right person for this gig. Chances are big that they are going to ask for an Electronic Press Kit (EPK).</p>
                    <h2>What to Include</h2>
                    <p>So here is what should be included in your Electronic Press Kit (EPK):</p>
                    <ul class="content-list">
                        <li>High-quality press photos</li>
                        <li>High-quality videos of some of the shows you have done</li>
                        <li>Logo's</li>
                        <li>Biography</li>
                        <li>Discography</li>
                        <li>Your Social Media handles</li>
                        <li>Your font (if you use a specific font for your communication)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Breaking Down Each Element</h2>
                    <p>Let's dive a little bit into every part.</p>
                    <h3>High-Quality Press Photos</h3>
                    <p>We already talked about creating press photos for your brand. These photos should be included in your Electronic Press Kit (EPK). Pick one to 5 photos that you think are the best and add those to the press kit.</p>
                    <h3>High-Quality Videos of Some of the Shows You Have Done</h3>
                    <p>If you have some high-quality videos from some of your gigs you can use these to give the promoter an impression of what you do.</p>
                    <h3>Logo's</h3>
                    <p>The logo that you have created for your brand should be in the press kit too. Make sure to add the highest quality possible so that the designer can use it for their flyers, posters, and online content. I would suggest adding a .PNG, .JPG, and .PSD file.</p>
                    <h3>Biography</h3>
                    <p>As an artist, you have a story. This is your biography. A biography should be a short story about an artist. What makes you, you? How did it all start, and what are your core values? This could be in the press kit in a simple word document. I recommend having the biography in both English and your mother language.</p>
                    <h3>Discography</h3>
                    <p>This is an overview of all the songs you have worked on. This gives the promoter the ability to recognize your work and promote it.</p>
                    <h3>Your Social Media Handles</h3>
                    <p>Send all the correct links to your social media so that the promoter won't end up promoting the wrong person. This could be sent in a word document.</p>
                    <h3>Your Font</h3>
                    <p>Some artists use a particular font representing their brand; if that's the case, make sure to put the font file in the press kit.</p>
                    <h2>Sharing Your Electronic Press Kit</h2>
                    <p>Now that you have filled this folder, it is time to zip it and upload it to Google Drive or your website, so it is easy to share later on. People rather have you send a link than all the documents in an email because it will fill their email until they can't receive anymore emails.</p>

                            <h4>Keep It Updated</h4>
                            <p>Keep your EPK updated. Outdated statistics or old press photos make you look inactive. Update it whenever you have new releases, achievements, or press photos.</p>
