# Deployment Notes

## Files Status

### ✅ Production Files (Deployed)
- All HTML files (`index.html`, `modules/*.html`, `lessons/**/*.html`)
- CSS files (`css/*.css`)
- JavaScript files (`js/*.js`)
- Assets in `assets/images/` and `assets/downloads/`
- Configuration files (`_headers`, `_redirects`, `wrangler.toml`)
- Data files (`data/content.json`)

### 🔧 Development Files (Not Deployed)
- `generate.py` - Build script to generate HTML from `content.json`
  - Run locally: `python3 generate.py`
  - Not needed in production (HTML is already generated)

### 📦 Should Move to R2
- `Course Material PDF/` directory
  - Contains large PDFs and images referenced in HTML
  - Currently in `.gitignore` (not in repo)
  - **Action**: Upload to R2 bucket, then update HTML references

## Migration to R2 Checklist

1. [ ] Create R2 bucket (`360-artist-assets`)
2. [ ] Upload `Course Material PDF/` contents to R2
3. [ ] Update HTML references from `../../Course Material PDF/...` to `/r2/...` or `/downloads/...`
4. [ ] Test file access via Pages Functions
5. [ ] Remove `Course Material PDF/` from local project (optional, after migration)

## Current File References

Files in `Course Material PDF/` are referenced in:
- `lessons/finance/02-invoicing.html`

- `lessons/marketing/07-creating-content.html`
- `lessons/management/02-artist-cycle.html`
