# Cloudflare Pages Configuration
# This file is optional for static sites on Cloudflare Pages
# Pages will automatically detect and deploy your static files

name = "360-artist-management-website"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"
pages_build_output_dir = "./"  # Directory containing static files to deploy

# R2 Bucket Configuration
# Create buckets in Cloudflare Dashboard: R2 > Create bucket
# Then bind them here to access from Workers/Pages Functions
[[r2_buckets]]
binding = "ASSETS"  # Name to use in your Worker code
bucket_name = "360-artist-assets"  # Your R2 bucket name

# Optional: Add more buckets for different file types
# [[r2_buckets]]
# binding = "PDFS"
# bucket_name = "360-artist-pdfs"

# Note: For Cloudflare Pages, you don't need [assets] configuration
# Pages automatically serves files from your repository root
# Use _headers and _redirects files for Pages-specific configuration
# 
# To use R2 with Pages:
# 1. Create buckets in Cloudflare Dashboard (R2 section)
# 2. Upload files to R2 buckets
# 3. Use Pages Functions (functions/ directory) to serve files from R2
# 4. Or use R2 public URLs if you enable public access
